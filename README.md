## Mackup vs Git

Mackup has the option to backup bash, neovim and more dotfiles.

In my personal preference, I rather have my dotfiles in git because dotfiles are a big part part of my workflow and they're changed often and having a proper history and version control is important to me.

Application configuration are more 'static' as a part of my workflow and they're not changed as often as dotfiles. Mackup is a great solution since it's less important to document the changes.
